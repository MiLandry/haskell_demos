# haskell_demo_helloworld
Demonstrating the basics of haskell

##Directions:
Fire up the Glorious Haskell Compiler Interpreter

`ghci`

Then load a file into ghci that you want to demo eg:

`:l 01helloHask.hs`

Once the file is loaded, it should have a variable called "d" which is supposed to demonstrate the module that was loaded, jo just type "d" after loading a module.

`d`

`>> hello, world!`
